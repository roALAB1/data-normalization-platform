## 🎉 What's New

### 🚀 Major Features

#### 750+ Professional Credentials (7.5x Expansion!)
Expanded from ~100 to **750+ professional credentials** across all major industries:

- **Healthcare**: 150+ credentials (MD, DO, RN, NP, PA, DDS, PharmD, RDN, LCSW, etc.)
- **Finance**: 80+ credentials (CPA, CFA, CFP, ChFC, CLU, CIMA, FRM, etc.)
- **IT/Technology**: 200+ credentials (CISSP, CEH, CCNA, AWS, Azure, CompTIA, OSCP, etc.)
- **Engineering**: 100+ credentials (PE, EIT, PMP, Six Sigma, LEED, etc.)
- **Supply Chain**: 50+ credentials (CSCP, CPIM, CTSC, CLTD, etc.)
- **Legal**: 40+ credentials (JD, LLM, Esq, etc.)
- **Education**: 60+ credentials (PhD, EdD, MA, MS, BA, BS, etc.)
- **Other Industries**: 70+ additional credentials

#### Hybrid Monorepo Architecture
Refactored the entire codebase into a **hybrid monorepo** structure:

- **Platform-wide library** at `/shared/normalization/` for internal use
- **Publishable package** at `/packages/normalization-core/` for external distribution
- **Modular organization** by domain (names, phones, emails, companies, addresses)
- **CJS + ESM + TypeScript** declarations for maximum compatibility
- **pnpm workspaces + Turborepo** for efficient builds

#### Publishable npm Package
The normalization library is now available as a standalone package:

```bash
npm install @normalization/core
```

```typescript
import { isCredential, ALL_CREDENTIALS } from '@normalization/core/names';
```

**Package Features**:
- 750+ professional credentials
- O(1) lookup performance using Sets and Maps
- Zero dependencies
- Full TypeScript support
- Modular imports by domain

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

All critical bugs have been resolved:

### Fixed: Hyphenated Names
**Issue**: Names like "Meng-Ling Erik Kuo" were incorrectly parsed as First: "-Ling"  
**Cause**: Credential matching (MEng) within hyphenated names  
**Fix**: Added negative lookahead/lookbehind to credential pattern to prevent matching within hyphenated compounds

**Examples**:
- ✅ "Meng-Ling Erik Kuo" → First: "Meng-Ling", Middle: "Erik", Last: "Kuo"
- ✅ "Jean-Paul Sartre" → First: "Jean-Paul", Last: "Sartre"
- ✅ "Mary-Kate Olsen" → First: "Mary-Kate", Last: "Olsen"

### Fixed: Generational Suffixes
**Issue**: "Albert L Gaffney III" treated "III" as last name  
**Fix**: Added comprehensive generational suffix detection (Jr., Sr., II, III, IV, V, 2nd, 3rd, etc.)

**Examples**:
- ✅ "Albert L Gaffney III" → First: "Albert", Middle: "L", Last: "Gaffney", Suffix: "III"
- ✅ "John Smith Jr." → First: "John", Last: "Smith", Suffix: "Jr."
- ✅ "Robert Downey Sr." → First: "Robert", Last: "Downey", Suffix: "Sr."

### Fixed: Pronouns Removal
**Issue**: "Emily Bouch (she/her)" marked as invalid  
**Fix**: Automatically detect and remove pronouns in parentheses

**Examples**:
- ✅ "Emily Bouch (she/her)" → "Emily Bouch"
- ✅ "Alex Chen (he/him)" → "Alex Chen"
- ✅ "Jordan Taylor (they/them)" → "Jordan Taylor"

### Fixed: Supply Chain Credentials
**Issue**: "Chaitanya Saha CSCP, CPIM, CTSC" kept credentials in name  
**Fix**: Added 50+ supply chain credentials (CSCP, CPIM, CTSC, CLTD, SCOR-P, etc.)

**Examples**:
- ✅ "Chaitanya Saha CSCP, CPIM, CTSC" → "Chaitanya Saha" (credentials removed)
- ✅ "John Doe CLTD" → "John Doe"

### Fixed: Multiple Parentheses Handling
**Issue**: "John Doe (he/him) (Ph.D.)" failed to parse  
**Fix**: Enhanced regex to handle multiple parenthetical expressions

**Examples**:
- ✅ "John Doe (he/him) (Ph.D.)" → "John Doe" (both removed)
- ✅ "Jane Smith (MBA) (she/her)" → "Jane Smith"

### Fixed: Vite HMR WebSocket Configuration
**Issue**: WebSocket connection errors in browser console during development  
**Fix**: Configured Vite HMR with wss protocol and port 443 in `vite.config.ts`

**Result**: Clean development experience with no console errors

## ⚡ Performance Improvements

### Optimized Credential Lookups
- **Before**: Array-based linear search O(n)
- **After**: Set-based lookup O(1)
- **Impact**: ~750x faster credential matching for large datasets

### Modular Data Structures
Organized credentials by domain for efficient loading:
- Healthcare credentials: `HEALTHCARE_CREDENTIALS` Set
- Finance credentials: `FINANCE_CREDENTIALS` Set
- IT credentials: `IT_CREDENTIALS` Set
- Combined: `ALL_CREDENTIALS` Set
