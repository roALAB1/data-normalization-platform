=== IMPLEMENTATION NOTES ===

1. All variations with/without periods should be added
2. All variations with/without spaces should be added
3. Retired indicators should be handled separately (strip the rank AND the retired indicator)
4. Some abbreviations are ambiguous (e.g., "CO" could be Commanding Officer or Correctional Officer)
5. Period-handling regex from v3.13.7 should work for these too (makes periods optional)
